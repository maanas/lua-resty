# lua-resty
lua - resty is just a place holder name for the version 2 of Single Sign On Module. The module has not taken any shape thats why the place holder. 
All the drizzle stuff will be replaced by the mysql.resty and most of the business logic will be implemented in lua code in side objects.
Stay Tuned.
